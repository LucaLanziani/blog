Hi there, I'm Luca (Nss) Lanziani, a software engineer currently based in Rome, and this is my personal page.

Here you can find some information about me, some of my previous [experience](pages/experience.html) and some of the [blog](blog/) posts I wrote (hopefully I'll write something) during these years.

Here is a short recap of my last experience:

* __nearForm__ JavaScript and microservices consultant (JavaScript/ Nodejs)
* __Betting platform__ Software Engineer and DevOps (Python / JavaScript),
* __FileRock__ Sync and backup multi-platform client (Python / wx)
* __Web Components Platform__ Software engineer (HTML5, JavaScript, css)
* __Linux Robot plaftform__ plugin systems and communication bus (C / libdl / pubsub).
