From time to time I need to note something down, from a snippet of code to some lorem ipsum. 

Of course I can open a text editor and paste the text there but **is it worth it to keep another window around** when I have already a browser open in one of my screens?

**Why not use the browser as notepad?**

Just copy this code into you url bar and press <enter>:


```
data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
```

And paste the content or start writing something in the body ;).
